# CoverImages
To rigorously assess the efficacy of our evolved steganographic techniques, we conducted a comprehensive performance comparison using a publicly available dataset of 24 color Kodak images sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sherylmehta/kodak-dataset). These images were first converted to 8-bit grayscale to ensure uniformity in evaluation and resized to a standardized resolution of 256 × 256 pixels. In adherence to ethical considerations—aimed at preventing any unintended cognitive strain or reader discomfort—we selectively curated 20 images for analysis. This meticulous approach not only enhances the reliability of our comparative study but also underscores the adaptability and robustness of the proposed techniques in practical applications.
